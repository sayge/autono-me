autono:me is a decentralized, end-to-end-encrypted social network that runs without any dedicated server software. You do not need to run a server on your computer, and you do not need to sign up for anything if you have a place where you can publish a file on the internet.

autono:me allows you to have social networking without being forced to submit your private information to centralized and unaccountable companies and effectively removes the risk of the government or any company spying on you. It uses trusted and tested encryption technology. Because it is Free Software, you can even check the source code yourself. If your friends also use autono:me, the program can fetch their files and display their posts to you.

autono:me removes the need to run special server software, which is often too hard to set up or too cumbersome to run for individuals and it works perfectly even if you are not always online.

Joining autono:me does not require you to sign up anywhere. To join autono:me, you must

  1. download the software
  1. create and edit your personal public stream file
  1. publish this file on your webspace, or publish it with Dropbox (or any other method that gives this file a public URL)
  1. publish or give your friends the URL, get their URLs
  1. the autono:me software on your computer then can be used to post updates and read the posts from your friends.

autono:me allows you to assign your friends different "aspects" (like: family, friends, work, sports and so on) and publish updates only to specific aspects.

At the moment, autono:me is in a pre-alpha stage. We welcome, however, advanced users and developers who can start using autono:me right now!

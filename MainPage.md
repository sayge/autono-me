Social networking without big brother or big servers.

autono:me provides fully private, fully decentralized, fully encrypted social networking which you can start to use right now. All you need is a small program, and some place where to publish a file online (e.g. Dropbox, a personal website, etc.).

autono:me removes the need to run special server software, which is often too hard to set up or too cumbersome to run for individuals and it works perfectly even if you are not always online.


Joining autono:me does not require you to sign up anywhere, because there is no central server that could spy on you. To join autono:me you must

  1. download the software
  1. create and edit your personal public stream file
  1. publish this file on your webspace, or publish it with Dropbox (or any other method that gives this file a public URL)
  1. publish or give your friends the URL, get their URLs
  1. the autono:me software on your computer then can be used to post updates and read the posts from your friends.

autono:me allows you to assign your friends different "aspects" (like: family, friends, work, sports and so on) and publish updates only to specific aspects.
